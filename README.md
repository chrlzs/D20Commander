# D20Commander

D20Commander is a command line tool for simulating dice rolls in tabletop roleplaying games, such as Dungeons and Dragons.

## Usage

To roll dice, run the following command:

```bash
python d20commander.py
```

The program will prompt you to enter a dice notation (e.g., '2d6' or '1d20+5'). It will then simulate the dice rolls and display the results.

Type 'exit', 'quit', or press Ctrl+C to quit the program.
